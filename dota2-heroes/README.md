# Scraping Dota 2 Heroes page
Environment: Debian (WSL) and Python 3.7.

## scrap_heroes.py
Scraping Heroes main page. Extracts URL for each Hero page and then scraps those URLs to get some data. This data is written to a CSV file.

## heroes_analytics.ipynb
Asking some questions about the Heroes and displaying data on Jupyter notebook.

## Warning
Valve finally redesigned the Dota webpage... so the script to scrap doesn't work anymore. Thanks, Volvo.
